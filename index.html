                Jeremy Parra is a 39-year-old intelligence researcher who enjoys camping, cycling and golf. He is
                entertaining
                and inspiring, but can also be very cowardly and a bit rude. He is an Australian Hindu. He started studying
                law
                at college but never finished the course.
                Physically, Jeremy is in pretty good shape. He is average-height with pale skin, dark brown hair and black
                eyes.
                He grew up in an upper class neighbourhood. After his father died when he was young, he was raised by his
                mother
                He is currently single. His most recent romance was with a receptionist called Sally Maggie Butler, who was
                12
                years older than him. They broke up because Sally wanted somebody less mean.
                Jeremy's best friend is an intelligence researcher called Paris Cooper. They have a very firey friendship.
                He
                also hangs around with Xavier Phillips and Hayden Hill. They enjoy meditation together.
